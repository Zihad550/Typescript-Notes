## About typescript

- What is typescript: It is a superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft.

  - It allows static strict typing.
  - Extra features interface, enums, tuples generics.
  - Supports modern features(arrow functions, let, const)
  - It is based on the .NET harmony specification.
  - compile time error.

- When we create something new by updating something old it is create superset of the old one.

- What's wrong with JavaScript:

  - Not suitable for large application.
  - Lacks strong typing.
  - Weird inheritance, unfamiliar syntax. Because Variable, array and object works different then other languages.
  - Only errors during runtime.
  - suffers type coercion. Like you can add integer with number, add boolean with number.

- Benefits of Typescript
  - typescript = javascript
  - compiles to javascript - runs everywhere
  - familiar object oriented programming
  - new features work everywhere
