## setup typescript for project

- tsc --init = to initialize a typescript project
- go to tsconfig.json file
- rootDir = where your ts file exists
- outDir = where you want all your js files to exist
- now you just write tsc = it will find the files automatically on the root dir
- tsc -w = now it will look if there are any change on ts file and automatically compile to js file
- you don't have to write tsc again and again

**for a specific to compile**

- tsc file-name = to compile ts into js
